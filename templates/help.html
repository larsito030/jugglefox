<img id="screenshot" src="img/screencast_jugglefox.png" alt="tutorial screenshot">
<p class="tutorial">You start the game by pressing the <strong>'Let's go' Button</strong>.
On the right hand side, you see a randomly generated number. Now it's your challenge to reach this number as fast as possible by adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing the numbers on the 16 tabs. At the bottom, you see the <strong>4 operator tabs for arithmetic calculations</strong>. There are only 1-digit-numbers in this game you can calculate with! You can select freely the first tab, but every subsequent tab needs to be adjacent to the previous one and must not have already been selected (dark grey color).</p><p class="tutorial"> If you press the <strong>'undo' button</strong>, all selected tabs for that round will be reset while maintaining all numbers on the tabs and the target number. If you press the <strong>'skip' button</strong>, a new target number will be generated at the expense of a penalty of 3 seconds. Once you've reached a target number, you start with a new round until you've completed 5 rounds.</p>
